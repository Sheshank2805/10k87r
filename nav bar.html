<p >we begin during the rule of Bharata, when everyone on Earth follows dharma. His lineage is traced to two sons: Dhrtarastra, who is blind and cannot inherit the throne, and Pandu, who becomes king. Pandu has one illegitimate son he must give up to be raised as a Suta and five sons to call his own, and all six are gods incarnate. Dhrtarastra has 100 sons (called Kauravas), all demons. Pandu's five sons Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhisthira, Nakula, and Sahadeva are all great warriors or great kings, and marry the princess Draupadi. Dhrtarastra's son Duryodhana leads the other 99 brothers, and has a seething hatred for the Pandavas, or Pandu's sons. Both Yudhisthira and Duryodhana are granted kingdoms by Dhrtarastra</p>

<p>After Yudhisthira is consecrated as king, Duryodhana schemes to take his kingdom. So, Duryodhana challenges Yudhisthira to a dice game. Duryodhana implores Yudhisthira to participate, and Yudhisthira determines that it's his dharma to play despite being a terrible gambler. He gradually gambles away his entire kingdom and the freedom of his wife, but Dhrtarastra commands Duryodhana to give Yudhisthira one more change. Duryodhana agrees, saying that if Yudhisthira loses he and the other Pandavas must live in exile for 12 years and spend a 13th year in disguise, and if they're recognized, they must spend another 12 years in exile. Yudhisthira loses.</p>

<p>During their 13th year, the Pandavas take refuge in the king Virata's palace, posing as former subjects of Yudhisthira. Draupadi poses as a maidservant to maintain her independence. It's an eventful year, with a rape attempt on Draupadi that leads to Bhima slaughtering all of the aggressor's supporters and Arjuna helping Virata's son win back cattle from thieves. The brothers make it through the 13th year undetected despite these showy adventures.</p>
